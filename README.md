## Environment Variables Setup

To configure your environment variables for EmailJS, you need to populate the `.env` file with the following variables. These variables are required for sending emails using EmailJS:

### Steps to Get Your EmailJS Credentials

1. **Sign in to EmailJS:**
   Go to [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/) and sign in to your account. If you don't have an account, you can create one for free.

2. **Create a New Email Service:**

   - Navigate to the "Email Services" section.
   - Click on "Add New Service" and follow the prompts to set up your email service.
   - Once the service is created, you'll get a `Service ID`. Copy this ID and paste it into the `VITE_SERVICE_ID` field in your `.env` file.

3. **Create a New Email Template:**

   - Go to the "Email Templates" section.
   - Click on "Create New Template" and design your email template.
   - Save the template, and you'll get a `Template ID`. Copy this ID and paste it into the `VITE_TEMPLATE_ID` field in your `.env` file.

4. **Get Your Public Key:**
   - Navigate to the "API Keys" section.
   - You will find your `Public Key` there. Copy this key and paste it into the `VITE_PUBLIC_KEY` field in your `.env` file.

### Example .env File

```plaintext
VITE_SERVICE_ID=your_service_id_here
VITE_TEMPLATE_ID=your_template_id_here
VITE_PUBLIC_KEY=your_public_key_here
```

By following these steps, you will ensure that your EmailJS configuration is correctly set up in your project.
